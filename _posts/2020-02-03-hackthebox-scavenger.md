An hard box by ompamo.  Really enjoyed this one, enumeration is key here, and many, many different kinds of enumeration will be needed.  I really liked how for a hacking challenge it really incorporated non-hacking disciplines into its exploitation.  A novel idea!

As this box is still active the walkthrough is not available.

{% highlight bash %}
# hostname
ib01
# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root),1004(customers)
#
{% endhighlight %}

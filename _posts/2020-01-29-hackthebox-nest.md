![HTB-Nest](/img/htb/nest.png)

An easy box by VbScrub.  This box has a lot to offer in lessons to a newer player.  Really enjoyed both the initial compromise down to the privilege escalation.  Enumeration is key!

As this box is still active the walkthrough is not available.

{% highlight bash %}
C:\Windows\system32>hostname
HTB-NEST

C:\Windows\system32>whoami
nt authority\system

C:\Windows\system32>
{% endhighlight %}

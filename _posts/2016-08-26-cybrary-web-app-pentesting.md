I completed my first [Cybrary](https://www.cybrary.it) course today to brush up on Web Application PenTesting.  I ran through it in a couple of hourse, and honestly skipped a couple parts that I felt I had a very good understanding of.  My overall experience was good, it had tons of good information and I quite liked the presenter.  I feel he did an good job at presenting an Introduction to Web Application Testing.

I would recommend this course for anyone starting out in WebApp PenTesting or anyone who has been away from it for a while.  I believe it helped me remember my previous training, as well as it introduced me to a couple of other tools that I had not previously been exposed to like sqlsus.  I really enjoyed it and plan on doing other trainings from Cybrary in the near future.

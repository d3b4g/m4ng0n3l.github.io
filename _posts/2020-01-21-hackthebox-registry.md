An hard box by thek.  I really enjoyed this box, it brings to light some pretty serious vulnerabilities in tools we see on a day to day basis.  The path to user and root were both excellent and the ability to script most of the interactions really makes this a good box to practice for the OSWE.

As this box is still active the walkthrough is not available.

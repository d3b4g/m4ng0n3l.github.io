Woot, so I got approved to take OSCP, so planning on starting that the end of September.  That gives me a month to get my feet wet on Exploit Development, since that is a very weak area of mine.

I'm expecting that with my previous trainings, and experiences that I won't have issues on many parts of it, but I know I'll have to Try Harder many, many, many times so electing to go with the 90 days of labs option so I can fully exploit everything there is in the Lab Environment before going to the exam.

An medium box by Cyb3rb0b.  Oh how I had a hard time with the initial compromise on this one.  That being said while I found it rough it was a great learning experience.  Additionally, I found it really useful for studying for my OSWE since it let me do a bit of scripting.  

As this box is still active the walkthrough is not available.

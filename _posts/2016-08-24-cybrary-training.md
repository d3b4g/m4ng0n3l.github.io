So today I got wind of a [Cybrary](https://www.cybrary.it).  Pretty neat free InfoSec training (and some other topics as well), something similar to [SecurityTube](http://www.securitytube.net).  It had quite a good selection of courses I want to take to brush up on pen testing and improve the skills.  So I'll post some reviews of those as I complete them.
